Your patient is Roy T:
</b></p><p>

4. Roy T. (63, Male) – Retired Transit Worker
</p><p>

    Location: Staten Island
</p><p>

    Background: Roy spent 35 years maintaining subway tunnels for the MTA. Retired on a modest pension. He’s a devout churchgoer and volunteers at a local soup kitchen. Married, with adult children who visit weekly.
</p><p>

    Medical History: ESRD from poorly controlled hypertension and Type 2 diabetes, diagnosed 15 years ago. Still smokes occasionally.
</p><p>

    Compliance: Mostly compliant, though he misses occasional appointments due to fatigue or pride.
</p><p>

    Support System: Stable but aging — wife is 65 and has health issues of her own.
</p><p>

    Insurance: Medicare + MTA union retiree plan (covers most transplant costs but some delays in referrals).
</p><p>

    Ethical Considerations: Blue-collar legacy; occupational exposure; mild ongoing risk factors (smoking); age and co-morbidities reduce long-term survival odds.
