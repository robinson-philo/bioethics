Your patient is Elena M:
</b></p><p>

1. Elena M. (36, Female) – Teacher & Caregiver
</p><p>

    Location: Yonkers, NY
</p><p>

    Background: Elena is a part-time public elementary school teacher and full-time caregiver for her elderly parents, who live with her and both have moderate dementia. She’s a single mother of a 14-year-old daughter who has started helping with household responsibilities. Elena's long-term goal is to return to full-time teaching.
</p><p>

    Medical History: Type 1 diabetes since age 11, leading to end-stage renal disease at 34. She's been on dialysis for 2 years and is reaching her physical limit.
</p><p>

    Compliance: Excellent, despite logistical and emotional stress. She never misses dialysis and manages her blood sugar meticulously.
</p><p>

    Support System: Thin but steady — daughter and a church friend rotate caregiver roles.
</p><p>

    Insurance: Medicaid + Medicare dual eligible (she qualified for disability after ESRD diagnosis). Copays are covered, but some services are out-of-network.
</p><p>

    Ethical Considerations: Acts as a multigenerational caregiver; time-sensitive need; motivated and adherent; faces structural hardship and limited mobility.
