2. Marcus R. (54, Male) – High-Income Attorney in Recovery
</p><p>

    Location: Upper West Side, Manhattan
</p><p>

    Background: Marcus is a high-powered corporate lawyer, semi-retired due to health. He’s married with three grown children and donates generously to public-interest law organizations. He previously struggled with workaholism and alcoholism, leading to relationship strain and missed early treatment opportunities.
</p><p>

    Medical History: ESRD caused by hypertension and alcohol-related damage. Declined early interventions but entered treatment after a health crisis. Now sober for 10 months and in outpatient counseling.
</p><p>

    Compliance: Excellent since recovery began. Underwent a lifestyle transformation.
</p><p>

    Support System: Full-time private nurse, chef, family support, and concierge medicine team.
</p><p>

    Insurance: Platinum-level employer retiree PPO (covers all transplant-related costs, including out-of-network providers, at top institutions).
</p><p>

    Ethical Considerations: Access privilege; high likelihood of transplant success; past non-compliance; current strong support and resources.
